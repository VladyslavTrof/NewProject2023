Input: [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: [[1,3,5],[2,4,6]]
Explanation: Suppose we are given a matrix
                       [[1, 2],
                        [3, 4],
                        [5, 6]]
Then the transpose of the given matrix will be,
                       [[1, 3, 5],
                        [2, 4, 6]]
